# Bank-Personal-Loan-Modelling-using-Naive-Bayes
This project is about Naive Bayes classifiers, a powerful probabilistic machine learning model based on Bayes' theorem. It includes training and interpreting a Naive Bayes model  using a real-world banking dataset.

# Bayesian Theorem and Naive Bayes ModelÂ¶
Naive Bayes classifiers are based on Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired. 
Despite its simplicity and the 'naive' assumption that features are independent, Naive Bayes is widely used for its effectiveness, particularly in text classification and spam filtering.
